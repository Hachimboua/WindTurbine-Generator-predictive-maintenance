The Challenge: Real-world Data to Predictive Insights
=====================================================

This project addresses the critical need for proactive maintenance in wind turbine systems.
Traditional reactive maintenance leads to costly downtime and inefficient operations.
Our goal is to build an AI-powered system that predicts component degradation, enabling
just-in-time maintenance and optimizing turbine performance.

From Real-World Weather to Wind Turbine Simulation
-------------------------------------------------

The foundation of understanding wind turbine behavior lies in accurate environmental data.
Our approach begins by acquiring **real-world weather data** to simulate realistic operating conditions.

1.  **Data Acquisition from Climate Data Store (CDS):**
    We leverage the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) **Climate Data Store (CDS)**,
    a reputable source for historical and forecasted climate data. Specifically, we retrieve
    meteorological variables crucial for wind turbine performance, such as:
    * **Wind speed components (u and v):** Essential for calculating actual wind speed and direction impacting the turbine rotor.
    * **Temperature:** Influences material properties and potential thermal stress on components.
    * **Humidity:** Can contribute to environmental wear and corrosion.
    * *(You can add other specific parameters you used from CDS here if applicable)*

    This data provides the realistic environmental context necessary for our simulations.

2.  **Simulink Wind Turbine Generator Simulation:**
    The acquired real weather data is then fed into a **Simulink-based wind turbine generator simulation model**.
    This simulation replicates the complex electromechanical dynamics of a wind turbine, allowing us to
    generate critical operational parameters under varying real-world weather conditions.
    Key outputs from the Simulink simulation include:
    * **Turbine Rotor Speed**
    * **Generator Speed (RPM)**
    * **Mechanical Torque (kNm)**
    * **Electrical Power Output (kW)**
    * **Vibration levels (simulated responses to operational conditions)**
    * *(List other crucial simulated outputs if you have them)*

    This step bridges the gap between raw weather data and the operational performance metrics of the turbine.

The Need for Synthetic Data Generation
-------------------------------------

While the Simulink simulation provides valuable insights into turbine behavior under real weather, directly
generating long-term, high-fidelity operational data through continuous, extensive simulations
presents significant challenges:

* **Computational Intensity:** Running detailed Simulink models for years of operational time
    at a high resolution (e.g., minute-by-minute) requires immense computational resources and time.
    Our current hardware capabilities **do not provide enough power** to perform such extensive simulations.
* **Data Volume for AI:** Training robust deep learning models for predictive maintenance requires
    large, diverse datasets covering various operational states, degradation patterns, and maintenance events.
    Simulink simulations, while accurate, might not easily scale to the vast volumes of data needed for
    effective AI model training.
* **Introducing Degradation & Maintenance:** Real-world degradation and maintenance events are complex
    and stochastic. Incorporating these phenomena directly and realistically into a pure physical Simulink
    model for long durations can be exceedingly difficult and time-consuming.

To overcome these limitations, we employ a strategy of **synthetic data generation**. This approach
allows us to extend the insights from our Simulink model and real weather data into a comprehensive dataset
that is specifically designed for training our predictive maintenance AI.
