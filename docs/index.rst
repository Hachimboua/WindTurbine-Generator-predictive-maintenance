Wind Turbine Predictive Maintenance: Dashboard
==============================================

This documentation provides comprehensive details on the Predictive Maintenance AI Dashboard,
a Streamlit application for forecasting component health and Remaining Useful Life (RUL)
using deep learning models. It covers the entire project lifecycle, from acquiring real-world
weather data and simulating a wind turbine's behavior, to generating synthetic operational
data for robust AI model training, and finally, deploying a dashboard for practical
predictive maintenance.
